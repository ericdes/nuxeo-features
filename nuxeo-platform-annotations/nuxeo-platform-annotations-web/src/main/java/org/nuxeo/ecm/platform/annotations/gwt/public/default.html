the frigid air with a sealskin whip, a Greenland hunter urges his dogs
across sea ice that gets thinner and less stable each year. Out here
he's always found game for his family—until now. The problem: The ice
is disappearing.<br><br>Jens Danielsen kneels on his dogsled as it
bumps through the glinting ruins of a frozen sea. "Harru, harru," he
calls out. "Go left, go left." "Atsuk, atsuk. Go right, go right." His
voice carries a note of urgency. The 15 dogs in his team move warily,
picking their way between lanes of open water and translucent sheaves
of upended ice. Despite bitter cold in late March, the ice pans have
shattered, making travel dangerous.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>In a normal winter
the ice comes to northwestern Greenland in September and stays until
June. But during the past few years there have been only three or four
weeks when the ice has been firm and the hunting good. "The sea ice
used to be three feet (0.9 meters) thick here," Jens says. "Now it's
only four inches (10.2 centimeters) thick."<br><br>As big as a bear,
with a kind, boyish face and an elegant mind, Jens is a 45-year-old
hunter from Qaanaaq, a village of about 650 people at latitude 77
degrees north whose brightly painted houses climb a hillside
overlooking a fjord. Along with his brothers-in-law, Mamarut
Kristiansen, Gedion Kristiansen, and Tobias Danielsen, who each has his
own dog team and sled, he's heading toward the ice edge on Smith Sound
to find walruses, as hunters have done for as long as memory. With 57
dogs to feed, as well as his extended family, he'll need to kill
several walruses on this trip to bring home any meat.<br><br>Before
leaving Qaanaaq, Jens had studied an ice chart faxed from the Danish
Meteorological Institute. It showed vast areas of open water all the
way to Siorapaluk, the northernmost indigenous village in the world.
This was bad news for the hunters, who planned to travel on the "ice
highway" for as long as a week. And it was a grim sign for the
ecosystem as well, since it reflected the warming trend scientists call
the polar amplification effect. During the past few decades
temperatures have risen in Greenland by more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit
(1 degree Celsius)—twice the global average—and the island's massive
ice sheet, almost two miles (3.2 kilometer) deep in some places, has
been melting faster than at any time during the past 50 years. As the
ice and snow cover melt, the Earth absorbs more heat—and sea levels
rise everywhere.</p><p><br>Arctic biologists say that the entire
ecosystem is in collapse. Without sea ice, seals can't build ledges on
which to rest, eat, and bear their pups. Walruses can't find refuge on
drift ice to rest and digest their meals of clams and other shellfish.
Polar bears can't catch seals if there's no ice. And hunters like Jens
can't travel in search of game.<br><br>"Huughuaq, huughuaq—get going,
go faster!" Jens calls, encouraging his team. His sled is 13 feet (4
meters) long and 4 feet (1.2 meters) wide, pulled by 15 dogs in a fan
hitch that lets them navigate the rough ice independently.<br><br>"These
dogs are half wild," Jens says. "Maybe we are too. They have to be a
little hungry to keep working for us, and we have to be hungry to keep
going out with them."<br><br>The sled tips and tilts as the dogs
scramble and bark. A fight breaks out, and Jens snaps a whip over their
backs until they pick up speed. When a line in the fan hitch snags and
a dog is dragged, Jens leans forward, without stopping, plucks at the
tangle, and the dog's leg is released.<br><br>As we weave between
stranded icebergs, Jens clamps his huge leg over mine and grabs my
shoulder to keep me from falling off the sled. After one jolting bump,
he raises his eyebrows to ask if I'm all right, then laughs when I nod
yes. We've traveled together many times since 1996, when he first
allowed me to accompany him on spring hunts for little auks, beluga
whales, ringed seals, and walruses, so there's no need for words.<br><br>By
the time the light fades about 11 p.m., we head toward shore and the
hunters make camp on a rocky beach. Everyone's in high spirits. Where
there had been open water a week earlier, now ice has congealed.
Perhaps hunting will be good after all.<br><br>Dogs are unhitched and
tied to notches cut in the ice. Sleds are unloaded. Two small canvas
tents are put up using harpoon shafts as tent stakes. In each tent two
sleds lined with reindeer skins serve as sleeping platforms. The floors
are ice. An ancient Primus stove is lit. Overhead a sealskin thong is
hung with sealskin boots, arctic hare socks, and a loaf of bread to be
thawed. In a battered pot teetering over the flame, a spangled piece of
glacier ice becomes water.<br><br>"Aurrit—walrus!" Jens sings out.
"There will be many out there," Mamarut says, meaning a few miles out
at the ice edge. The hunters prepare for an all-night hunt, changing
out of fox-fur anoraks into ones made of lined canvas with polar bear
fur at the wrists. Jens sharpens his knives as Gedion coils green
harpoon lines. "We're going to the ice edge, the place where winter
becomes spring," Jens says.<br><br>About midnight the fading sun is a
red orb banging at the horizon. As darkness bleeds into it, the
temperature plummets to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 40 degrees
Celsius). Night will be brief—in a few hours the sun will swing east
again.<br><br>Harpoons in hand, the men line up single file and begin
walking. Mamarut leads, Jens and the others follow, careful to place
their feet into Mamarut's track. "The walruses can hear us moving over
the ice, so we must make it sound like we are just one hunter," Jens
whispers.<br><br>We walk for an hour in our silent Ice Age procession.
These men are among the last hundred or so Greenland hunters who have
chosen to keep their ancient traditions alive—traveling by dogsled,
wearing skins, hunting with spears and harpoons, while taking what they
want from the modern world, such as rifles. Their ancestors came to
Greenland about 800 years ago, the most recent wave of peoples who
migrated from Siberia beginning some 5,000 years ago.<br><br>"We hunt
with harpoons, but we also use cell phones and watch TV," says Jens,
who has testified before Greenland's Parliament to keep snowmobiles out
of the far north. New ice—ice that has just refrozen—undulates like
rubber beneath our feet. A slender channel of water appears, its
crenellations catching and dropping the last of the sunlight. "The ice
edge," Jens whispers. He points: "Miteq!" Two eider ducks fly out of a
maze of sparkle.<br><br>Mamarut motions for us to stop. We hear gulping
and sloshing: Walruses coming. They bob up and down, their ivory tusks
gnawing frigid water. Mamarut breaks out of the procession, crouches,
and runs ahead to the edge of the lead. We wait motionless. There's the
whir of a harpoon, then a gunshot. The walrus is dead.<br><br>Harpoon
lines are tied to long iron poles. A modern block and tackle is
attached and the four men line up, hauling the young 800-pound
(363-kilogram) male onto the ice hand over hand. Knives are
resharpened. Penis and flippers are cut off. Heart and liver are laid
on a tarp along with the other meat—food for both humans and dogs.<br><br>Jens
walks back to camp and returns with a sled, his rolling side-to-side
gait like that of a polar bear. He cuts a tangle of guts into long
lengths </p></body></html>
