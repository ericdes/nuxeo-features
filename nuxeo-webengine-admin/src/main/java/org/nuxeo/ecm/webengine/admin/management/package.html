<p>This module provides a REST API for runtime managament.</p>

<p>The module defines an ATOMPUB service that expose collections to introspect and
manage Nuxeo bundles, components, contributions and files resources deployed on
a running server.</p>

<p>Clients can introspect the service document to detect the service collections
in order to navigate, to get and post data.</p>

<p>Feeds that expose information like available extension points or contributions
in a component, or available components in a bundle, can be retrieved by clients
by reading custom atom link tags on the feed entries.</p>

<p>Apart the REST API there is also a HTML interface to browse runtime components.</p>

<p>The REST API is useful for client tools like Eclipse IDE plugins to browse
Nuxeo components, to hot deploy new contributions or other resources.</p>

<p>The HTML interface is useful to browse bundles, components, contributions and
extension points deployed on the server.</p>

<p>For now only resources (configuration files, schemas) can be posted using the
API. In future it will be possible to deploy new extensions and to reload
components or bundles too.</p>

<p>The application is designed as a pure JAX-RS application (without using
WebEngine object model) but make use of freemarker templates to build response
to clients.</p>

<p>In the future this application may be moved outside nuxeo-webengine-admin in a
dedicated project.</p>

<p>The ATOMPUB service document is available under the /server path of the HTTP
server. Ex: at http://localhost:8080/server</p>

<p>The HTML interface is available at /server/html.</p>

<p>Here are all the paths exposed:</p>

<ul>
<li>GET http://host:port/server - the ATOMPUB service document
<li>GET http://host:port/server/html - the entry point of the Web interface (not REST)
<li>GET http://host:port/server/bundles - the bundles collection
<li>GET http://host:port/server/components - the components collection
<li>GET http://host:port/server/resources - the resources collection
<li>GET http://host:port/server/resources/@schemas - the document schema files (read only)
<li>GET http://host:port/server/resources/@components - the persisted components contributed by the user (read only)
<li>GET http://host:port/server/resources/@reload - reload the resource class loader.
<li>GET http://host:port/server/bundles/{symbolicName} - the bundle entry
<li>GET http://host:port/server/components/{componentName} - the component entry
<li>GET http://host:port/server/components/{componentName}/xpoints - the xpoints provided by a bundle
<li>GET http://host:port/server/components/{componentName}/xpoints - the contributions provided by a bundle
<li>GET http://host:port/server/components/{componentName}/{xpoint} - the feed of all extensions contributed to the {xpoint} extension point
<li>GET http://host:port/server/system_properties - the system properties
<li>GET http://host:port/server/runtime_properties - the runtime properties
<li>POST http://host:port/server/system_properties - define a new system property
<li>POST http://host:port/server/runtime_properties - define a new runtime property
<li>POST http://host:port/server/resources - post a new resource
<li>POST http://host:port/server/components - upload and deploy a new component
<li>DELETE http://host:port/server/components/{name} - remove a persisted component. 
	Only components persisted explicitly by the user (using POST or being added in the ${nxserver.home}/data/extensions directory by hand) can be removed
<li>PUT http://host:port/server/components/{name} - switch the state of the component (activate/deactivate)
	When activating a component all of its extension points becomes available, 
	and all of its extensions are contributed to the target components. 
	When deactivating it, its extension points are disabled and and any contribution made by the component is removed.  
</ul>

<p>
<b>Not yet implemented:</b>
<ul>
<li>POST http://host:port/server/bundles - upload and install a new bundle
<li>PUT http://host:port/server/bundles/{symbolicName} - switch the state of the bundle (install/uninstall)
<li>DELETE http://host:port/server/bundles/{symbolicName} - completely remove from he server the given bundle 
</ul>

<p>
HTTP return codes are not yet defined. All method will usually return 200 or 500 if an exception is thrown by the server
